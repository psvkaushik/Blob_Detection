# Laplacian_Blob_Detection

Implemented Blob detection by applying Laplacian scale-space representation as well as 2-D and 3-D non-maximum suppression.
Used Laplacian of Gaussian and Difference of Gaussian filters and compared the results.
Experimented with different thresholds, standard deviations, and constant multiplier values to achieve the appropriate number of blobs and
runtime for various images
